Thank you for playing our mod! We've been waiting to do this mod for quite a while (since omnipresent v2 was announced),
and now we get to release this to you! This mod uses assets from restoration of sonic.exe and exeternal,
but nothing was leaked in doing so (i think, maybe an icon or 2), all assets used were either already leaked or shown off, and this mod is not
affiliated with either of those mods (even tho the director is a coder for one of them lmao).
All credits are in the credits section of the mod (in game).
Hope you enjoy the mod!
